# e_commerce

This project is more than just writing lines of code; it's my personal adventure in gaining knowledge and improving my skills. Building this Flutter E-commerce app with API integration is a result of my deep interest in technology and my aspiration to excel in this field.

Technology Stack:
· Flutter

What I've learned through this project:

· I've figured out how to connect the app with an API.
